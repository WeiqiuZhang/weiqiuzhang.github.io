## About me

Hi! I am Weiqiu ZHANG, an enthusiast of Educational Research, in particular EduTech (Educational Technology) & Game-Based Learning & Community Service Learning.

I got my MA degree from [The Education University of Hong Kong](https://www.eduhk.hk/en/), my BA degree from [Northwest Normal University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Normal_University) where I got the *Teacher's Qualification of Senior Secondary School* for China Mainland.

I was also a former K-12 teacher for Chinese Subject; the time in *Hualin Township Central School* with left-behind students and ethnic minority students became an unforgettable memory of mine.

## Projects

### 2D interactive multi-ending game for *The Peach Blossom Spring(桃花源记)* (Made by Unity/C#)

By hovering and clicking the mouse, players can gradually unlock story, immersively understanding the background and plot of the game. Below is a gif for a quick preview:

Here are the outline of five endings and extra story:
- **不复得路(主结局)**: 人类的欲望与桃花源是否可以兼得?(Main ending:Can human desires and the utopian society coexist?)  
- **南柯一梦**: 理想社会是否只存在于人们的想象中? (Does the utopian society only exist in imagination?)  
- **雨夜梦醒**: 外界的介入是否会打破桃花源的资源平衡?(Does external interference threaten the delicate harmony of resources in the utopian society?)  
- **大隐隐于世**: 桃花源的理想与现实生活的妥协。(A balance between the dream of seclusion and the demands of real life.)  
- **不知有汉**: 时空错位催生了海市蜃楼般的桃花源幻想。(The dislocation of time and space creates a mirage-like illusion of the utopian society.)  
- **南阳刘子骥**: 个人追求与社会舆论的矛盾。(The conflict between personal aspirations and societal opinions.)
